Improvements in the code ::
### I have used Sonalint for analyzing the Code
## Accesibility is not well designed for example: user is
   not able to traverse through content of books using keyboard
## aria-labels were not assigned to the components
## there is a redundant await
## alt tags were not present for the images.
## added aria-labels but need to work on making 
  components accesible through keyboard

### Light House Report 
## changed button names and text color
## light house report is now 100%
